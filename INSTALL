1. Deploy
Copy the file where you want to put the Photo Album and access it through your browser: 
you'll now notice that a ".htaccess" file and a "gallery" folder have been created in the file system.

2. Config
Open the .php file with your preferred text editor. At the beginning of the source code you can modify 
the default timezone, the Administration Panel credentials, the Photo Album title and add/remove links in the Top-Right menu.

3. Create albums and upload pictures
You can choose to create albums and upload pictures using the Administration Panel. 
However, you can do it by using your preferred FTP client too: locate the "gallery" folder where you deployed the Photo Album. 
Inside this folder just create another one with the name of the album (if needed) and upload your pictures.
